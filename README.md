[Changing a commit message](https://docs.github.com/es/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/changing-a-commit-message).
* If a commit message contains unclear, incorrect, or sensitive information, you can amend it locally and push a new commit with a new message to GitHub. You can also change a commit message to add missing information.
